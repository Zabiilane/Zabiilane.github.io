                        Hey there! I'm Elizabeth Jacaban, and I'm currently working my way through a <strong>Bachelor of Science in Information Systems (BSIS)</strong>. 
                        What started as curiosity about how websites actually work has turned into a genuine interest in building things that people can actually use. 
                        There's something satisfying about writing code that does exactly what you tell it to—most of the time, anyway.
                    </p>
                    <p class="intro-paragraph">
                        When I'm not buried in textbooks or debugging code, you'll find me experimenting with different frameworks and languages. 
                        I've been diving into Vue.js for frontend work, Laravel for backend projects, and I've got some experience with C++ and C# under my belt. 
                        HTML and CSS are my go-to for making things look decent, though I'm still figuring out why centering a div can be so complicated.
                    </p>
                    <p class="intro-paragraph">
                        This portfolio is basically my digital playground—a place where I can showcase what I've learned so far and keep track of how far I've come. 
                        It's a work in progress, just like me.
                    </p>
